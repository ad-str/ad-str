### What's up!? 👋

I'm Adam! I'm an incoming Software Developer Intern at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in DC! I have been and currently work full-time as a Research Assistant at the Wharton School, while also studying part-time as a CS Master's student at Penn in the Master's in Computer and Information Technology Program.

### 🫀 My Values:
- **My Strengths are Another's Superpower**: The reason I grow is to improve my efficacy in helping others. I ask who not what I'm doing this for.
- **Excited to Fail**: Not just to stay postive after failing, but accept beforehand that it is part of learning process, so as to keep my ambition unhindered.
- **United Empowerment**: Come from a place of empathy, respect, and sincerity in any scenario. Lift each other up, invest in one another, and we'll all reap the benefits.
- **Commited to Curiosity**: Always ask questions. Always strive to understand how things work. If something works well, ask if it can be better. 
- **Stay Grounded**: Appreciate everyone who has helped me in my journey and recognize I am bigger than me.
- **Prioritize Play**: That's what life's all about :) 

### 🤓 I geek out on:
- 🎮 GAMES! I will literally talk to you about them or, better yet, play them with you for hours!
