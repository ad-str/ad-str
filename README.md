I'm Adam! I currently work full-time as a Research Assistant at the Wharton School, while also studying part-time as a Master's student. Ignited by the fascination with the technology I used for research, I decided to work towards a career in software engineering instead, and I couldn't be more excited!

💻 Currently working on:
- A Master's in Computer and Information Technology at the Unversity of Pennsylvania
- SportsGenie: A sports prediction website in collaboration with 3 other developers
- Solid-Barnacle: hehe it's a secret
- Leetcode 😵‍💫

🫀 My Values:
- **My Strengths are Another's Superpower**: The reason I grow is to improve my efficacy in helping others. I ask who not what I'm doing this for.
- **Excited to Fail**: Not just to stay postive after failing, but accept beforehand that it is part of learning process, so as to keep my ambition unhindered.
- **United Empowerment**: Come from a place of empathy, respect, and sincerity in any scenario. Lift each other up, invest in one another, and we'll all reap the benefits.
- **Stay Hungry**: Don't be satisfied with the status quo. If something works well, ask if it can be even better.
- **Stay Grounded**: Appreciate everyone who has helped me in my journey and recognize I am bigger than me.

🤓 I geek out on:
- 🎮 GAMES! I will literally talk to you about them about them or, better yet, play them with you for hours!
- Currently playing: ToTK, FF16
- Perpetually playing: League of Legends, Rocket League, Overwatch 2, Pokemon
- Want to play: Diablo 4, Phantom Liberty
