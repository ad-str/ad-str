### What's up!? 👋

I'm Adam! I'm a graduate student in the Master's of Computer and Information Technology program at the University of Pennsylvania where I am currently in my last semester (expected graduation May 2025). I just finished a Software Engineering Internship at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, DC. I used to work in economic research as a Research Assistant at the Wharton School of Business but became too fascinated with some of the software tools I was using that I decided to pursue a more technical career! Excited for any opportunity to learn some new tech! Currently enjoying network programming and distributed systems.

### 💻 Currently working on:
- A Master's in Computer and Information Technology at the Unversity of Pennsylvania - Expected Graduation Dec 2024

### 🫀 My Values:
- **My Strengths are Another's Superpower**: The reason I grow is to improve my efficacy in helping others. I ask who not what I'm doing this for.
- **Excited to Fail**: Not just to stay postive after failing, but accept beforehand that it is part of learning process, so as to keep my ambition unhindered.
- **United Empowerment**: Come from a place of empathy, respect, and sincerity in any scenario. Lift each other up, invest in one another, and we'll all reap the benefits.
- **Commited to Curiosity**: Always ask questions. Always strive to understand how things work. If something works well, ask if it can be better. 
- **Stay Grounded**: Appreciate everyone who has helped me in my journey and recognize I am bigger than me.
- **Prioritize Play**: That's what life's all about :) 

### 🤓 I geek out on:
- 🎮 GAMES! I will literally talk to you about them or, better yet, play them with you for hours!
